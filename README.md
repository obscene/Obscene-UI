# obscene.css
obscene is a boilerplate stylesheet for mobile webapps especially for iOS


## Usage ##
Obscene.css is under development right now.     
Check again later or [Watch](https://github.com/rofrischmann/Obscene.css/subscription) this repository to get instant news.     

## Benefit ##
* Modern & flat Apps with native look (iOS)
* Fully scalable and responsive
* Focus straightforward on development while Obscene.css does all your styling
* Easy to customize (colors, ...)
* Build to use with [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) ([More Information](#Coming-soon)

## Browser Support ##
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari
* IE
    
You might have some issues with old versions of IE and Android build-in Browser.


## Coming soon ##
Obscene.css will soon support all common UI elements e.g. list, grid, tabview, slides or inputs.
   
I am planing to create a small mvc oriented framework for web apps that keeps as much user freedom as possible.


## Custom Build ##
Obscene.css is made with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and build with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).    
You'll need to install Grunt, Sass and Ruby (should be already installed on Mac OS & Linux).


```sh
cd path/to/obscene/
sudo npm install
```

Running 
```sh
grunt
```
builds obscene.css at `path/to/obscene/bin`.

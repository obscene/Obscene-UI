Obscene UI is a responsive, mobile-friendly UI-Template to build stable and beautiful app themes


## Usage ##
Made with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and build with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
You'll need to install Grunt, Sass and Ruby (should be already installed on Mac OS & Linux).


```sh
cd path/to/obscene/
sudo npm install
```

Running
```sh
grunt THEME
```
builds THEME.min.css within `path/to/obscene/bin`.

Read the [Documentation](http://unverschaemt.github.io/Obscene-Theme/docs/) to get familiar with the structure and classes.
If you need functionality such as tab switching and auto-sizing, please check [Obscene.js](https://github.com/unverschaemt/Obscene.js).   
If you're into [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) take a look at [Obscene](https://github.com/unverschaemt/Obscene) which is a full-featured UI Library build on Obscene UI and Obscene.js.
